This is an emulation of the Nintendo/Sony sound module used in the Super NES / Super Famicom (consisting of an SPC700 processor and a custom audio DSP) that runs in one P2 cog.

## Features:
- 8 channels of BRR sample playback
- 32kHz sample rate, accurate to real S-DSP
- SPC700 CPU emulation with instruction timings

## Misfeatures:
- Requires ~200 MHz P2 clock or higher
  (If clock isn't way too low, it fails gracefully by skipping SPC700 cycles)
- Some tunes exhibit minor clicking..
- Inaccurate Timer 2 emulation
