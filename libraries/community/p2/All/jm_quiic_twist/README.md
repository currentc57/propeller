Description:
This object is a C-to-Spin2 translation of the Qwiic Twist library for  the Sparkfun Qwiic Twist encoder. This product connects via I2C which allows multiple devices to share one set of pins (I2C bus). All functions in the original library are supported in the Spin2 library (though naming conventions conform to JM's Spin2 style guidelines).

Note that the Qwiic Twist uses I2C clock stretching to manage bus requests; the I2C driver included in the demo file supports this feature.
