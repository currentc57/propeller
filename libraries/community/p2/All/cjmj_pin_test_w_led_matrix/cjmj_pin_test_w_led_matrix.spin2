purpose   :  Testing the pins on Parallax's Propeller 2 Evaluation Board (Rev C) P/N 64000 using the LED Matrix board P/N 64006(c) RevB from the P2-ES Eval Board Accessory Set P/N 64006-ES.

notes     :  The LED matrix board does not reflect the layout in the schematic.  Instead it is laid out according to the lookup table (LUT) in the guide.
