## Description

A simple object for interfacing with Nextion HMI displays that is compatible with the protocol and HMI code used by the Arduino Easy Nextion Library. 

The Arduino library was developled by Thanasis Seitanis.  It uses a custom protocol that is simple to use and can be easily modified to meet oneâ€™s needs.
It was designed to provide a simple method to use Nextion displays for beginners and at the same time satisfying the needs of the more advanced programmers.

Full documentation on the Arduino Easy Nextion Library and protocol, as well as examples, can be found at https://seithan.com/Easy-Nextion-Library/

If you find this library useful, please consider supporting the author of the original Easy Nextion Library, Thanasis Seitanis at: [seithagta@gmail.com](https://paypal.me/seithan)

**NOTE**: `.HMI` files for Nextion Editor are also included in the demo folder.

## The public methods
- `start()`
- `writeNum()`
- `writeStr()`
- `writeByte()`
- `pushCmdArg()`
- `sendCmd()`
- `addWave()`
- `readNum()`
- `readStr()` 
- `readByte()`
- `cmdAvail()`
- `getCmd()`
- `getCmdLen()`
- `getCurrentPage()`
- `getLastPage()`
- `setCurrentPage()`
- `setLastPage()`

**NOTE** previous version had a `getSubCmd` method that exactly duplicated the functionality of `readByte`, it has been removed.  If you used `getSubCmd` in your code, just replace it with `readByte`  

In order for the object to update the Id of the current page, you must write the Preinitialize Event of every page: `printh 23 02 50 XX` , where `XX` the id of the page in HEX.
Your code can then read the current page and previous page using the `getCurrentPage()` and `getLastPage()` methods.

Standard Easy Nextion Library commands are sent from the Nextion display with `printh 23 02 54 XX` , where `XX` is the id for the command in HEX.  
Your code should call the `listen()` method frequently to check for new commands from the display.  You can then use the `cmdAvail`, `getCmd()` and `readByte()` methods to parse any commands.

example:
```spin
PUB main()
    nextion.listen                          ' need to run this to check for incoming data from the Nextion
    if nextion.cmdAvail > 0                 ' has the nextion sent a command?
      callCommand(nextion.getCmd)           ' get the command byte and see parse it        

PRI callCommand(_cmd)                       ' parse the 1st command byte and decide how to proceed
  case _cmd
    "T" :                                   ' standard Easy Nextion Library commands start with "T"
      callTrigger(readByte)                 ' so we need the second byte to know what function to call    
                                            ' custom commands can be added by expanding this case statement

PRI callTrigger(_triggerId)                 ' use the 2nd command byte from nextion and call associated function
  case _triggerId
    $00 :
      trigger00                             ' the orginal Arduino library uses numbered trigger functions
    $01 :
      trigger01
    $02 :
      runCount                              ' but since we are parsing ourselves, we can call any method we want
```

**NOTE**: This Spin object requires the use of a custom version of FullDuplexSerial.spin called FullDuplexSerialAvail.spin that adds a function to return the number of bytes in the rx_buffer

**NOTE**: Spin on the Proppeller 1 chip has a limit of 64 of items in a case statement.  For complexe Nextion systems use of custom commands in addition to the "T" command can be used to avoid this limit.  Alternatively case statements can be nested inside another structure.
Example:
```spin
PRI callTrigger(_triggerId)  'use the 2nd command byte from nextion and call associated function
  if _triggerId < $40
    case _triggerId
      $00 :
        trigger00

      'many more cases

      $39 :
        trigger40
  elseif _triggerId < $80
    case _triggerId
      $50 :
        trigger50
      'and more cases
```

**NOTE**: Spin on the Proppeller 1 chip also has a limit of 256 methods in an object, so care should be taken when planning the structure of a complex Nextion system. 


##  Usefull Tips

**Manage Variables**
You can read/write the variables as any other component.

Use `readNum()` to read the value of a numeric variable.  
Example: `nextion.readNum(STRING("va0.val"))`  
Example: `nextion.readNum(STRING("sys0"))`

Use `writeNum()` to change the value of a numeric variable.  
Example: `nextion.writeNum(STRING("va0.val"), 255)`  
Example: `nextion.readNumber(STRING("sys0"), 375)`

Use `readStr()` to read the text of a String variable.  
Example: `nextion.readStr(STRING("va0.txt"))`

Use `writeStr()` to change the text of a String variable.  
Example: `nextion.writeStr(STRING("va0.txt"), STRING("Hello World"))`

For this to happen, the variables you want to read/write must be at the page you are currently on.  
Otherwise, if the variables are of **global** scope, you will need to use a prefix with the page name that the variables are at.  
Example: `nextion.readNumber(STRING("page0.va0.val"))`   'If the variable is at page0  
The same goes for the other methods as well.

**NOTE**: (from the Nextion Editor Guide)
> In an HMI project a page is a localized unit. When changing pages, the existing page is removed from memory and the > > requested page is then loaded into memory. As such components with a variable scope of _**local**_ are only accessible while the page they are in is currently loaded. Components within a page that have a variable scope of _**global**_ are accessible by prefixing the page name to the global component .objname.
As an Example:
 A global Number component n0 on page1 is accessed by **page1.n0** . 
A local Number component n0 on page1 can be accessed by page1.n0 or n0, but there is little sense to try access a local component if the page is not loaded. Only the component attributes of a global component are kept in memory. Event code is never global in nature.
